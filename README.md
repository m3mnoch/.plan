so, had an email exchange with the cards against humanity guys.  i thought it would be fun to take advantage of their creative commons license, and use their cards as a demo for our audience. specifically as an example on how to structure their own mutliplayer games.

after chatting a bit, it seems like they're getting lots of folks abusing their license . . .

hey, people: STOP ABUSING THE CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE!

because, dammit, you're going to ruin it for the rest of us!
