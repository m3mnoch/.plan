so much strategy!

hopefully, we'll be able to work through decisions on things like identity, the part mana plays, and any intrinsic risks we can foresee with all our plans.

my calendar just got wiped-and-reset for the week while i'm down here in buenos aires.

doh!

we're doing an internal "dogfooding" hackathon this week.  man, i hope i can find time to play!  i have so many things i want to build!

came up for air on the documents i'm reviewing.  had a thought.

the enormity of what we're building is not lost on us.  i promise.  what's interesting, is that i suspect many other players in the space are missing it.

meaning, true digital asset ownership changes everything.

for example:

1) you make your virtual world digital assets truly ownable.  yay, hats on the blockchain!

2) a user can modify that asset with a different service.

3) that asset can be used in a different game.

4) if a user truly owns their hat, they will want to truly own their avatar.

5) if they truly own their avatar, they can do horrible things to that avatar and force a centralized company to censor that avatar and its items.

6) someone else not in your nation state will allow that avatar and their in a competing world or game.

7) at best, your tools just become content creation tools for other games and applications.  at worst, your world becomes a ghost town.

true digital asset ownership means true digital asset portability -- and there's NOTHING the naive "look at us!  we've got items on the blockchain!" company can do about it.

and none of this even touches the legal implications -- like, who owns your cryptokitty?  what happens when a non-nation state does what they want with the data?

because, now that real, cryptographically secure, economic scarcity exists, there will soon be such a thing as a "non-nation state".

like i said, true digital asset ownership changes everything.  absolutely everything.
