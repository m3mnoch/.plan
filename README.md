lately, i've been thinking pretty deeply on all the weirdness around migrating traditional game development stuff to the blockchain.

here's a list of randomness:

- complete decentralization means no traditional servers
    - that makes tracking a game's necessary authoritative state _really_ hard.
- players own their stuff
	- game experience needs to be compelling, or you are just a tool to create assets
	- their stuff is scarce, but non-rival
- marketplace fees aren't really possible since it's usually a one-at-a-time transaction
	- not even for ad/placement revenue (a tcr could replace this)
	- like exchanges, they require escrow into a private database
- hard currency is NOT like having your own erc20 token
	- players own the items, they don't need to transact in your currency
	- the value will likely be determined by exchange markets, not you
	- prices in your own item marketplace will fluxuate based on token value
	- reputation, reputation, reputation
- blockchain history can be traded
    - position on the leaderboard
    - access to tournaments based on leaderboard
- becoming a tool instead of a game
    - your elegant avatar maker building avatars for other games
- you can't iterate away mistakes
    - once you give out an nft, you can't get it back.
    - you can't change the properties of nfts once you give them out
- speedy transactions on a sidechain
    - the more data you give to the player in a side chain (whether or not they hit a boss with a rocket), the more damage they can do by trading them to other players.
    - selling the stream of tokens for "beating a boss" that awarded me an achievement token so other folks can be awarded that same achievement.

i'm now pretty interested in the "line in the sand" as to which blockchain transactions are going to be useful for games and which are not.  and, if that line is shifted back more towards high-utility, infrequently-granted asset nfts, do we really need a sidechain for games?
