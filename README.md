listening to chris dixon on the boostvc podcast.  i've long been a fan.  we've got a lot of the same opinions about things.

also!  HE DOES THE CHRIS-RANT ABOUT FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THERE'S REAL DIGITAL SCARCITY BECAUSE OF BLOCKCHAIN!!

warning: he talks really, really fast.

hashed mostly through avatar-related stuff.  lots of 'how far can we stretch our platform to build fun things?' questions.

that'd be pretty cool.

to the codez!!
