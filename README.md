man.  one of the things that bugs me the most is high-confidence, low-experience, bad-intuition engineers.  

they tend to have outsized influence with non-engineers because of their ability to sound like they know what they're talking about.  but, in reality, they just spout stupid.  usually, it's just a phase, but it can be almost dangerous along the way as they make tons of work for people like me to unwind.

so, [i tend to be cranky and condescending with them](https://www.reddit.com/r/decentraland/comments/8gum3o/i_am_esteban_founder_and_tech_lead_at/dyhbewv/?st=jh276ynw&sh=fce835e9).
