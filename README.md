oh goodness!  i've seen previews of our first iteration of avatars and they are winning!  i say it all the time, but shibu is SO GOOD.

and, on that note, we're talking a lot about identity.

for example, i relayed the old [metaplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplace) story about avatar creation.

so, metaplace was very likely the first mmo on the web where you could click a link on some random web page, and be transported directly to a specific part of a virtual world.  that meant, you could have a website about your virtual zoo where you talked about each animal and its history.  from there, you could click a link, and be transported right to that animal's pen where you could play and interact with them.

it was pretty powerful.

but, about the avatars -- we also had a unique problem in that when you, as a brand new metaplace user, clicked a link, expecting to see a lion den, but instead you were hijacked to a character creation screen instead, you bounced.

turns out, people hated that.

the analogy is like, clicking a link to read a web article, but being redirected to the site's registration form.

so, our solution was to randomly generate your avatar and just drop you into the zoo where you were expecting to land.

and, omg, did people HATE that.

"why the f*ck am i a black woman?!?!"

eep.

so, we ended up just defaulting you to a ghostly, gender-neutral avatar, let you enjoy the context of your visit, and then popped a notification that you should visit our avatar makeover shop.

victory.
