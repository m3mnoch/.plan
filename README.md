while i was taking my oldest to school this morning, on the drive home, i was running through a fun game idea for decentraland.  i wanted to take my supernatural steampunk mahjong-like game and push it into dcl.

it's very crypto-collectible friendly.  with chunky, 3d, physical pieces you stack to play with -- as opposed to something 2d like a card.  it should mix well.

the ip is fun.  it's got 4 tile factions (plus factionless equipment tiles) -- humans, werewolves, vampires, and zombies.  each with their own flavor and strengths.  werewolves are about buffs, vampires about control, zombies about debuffs.  and humans can do everything, but it's just more expensive.

in my head, the early game is about collecting and building tilesets.  practice and one-on-one battling other players.  late game becomes more faction-territory-focused -- rival gangs, strength in numbers (save those commons!), stuff like that.

i think it can be a pretty sweet game.  i'll have to keep it top of mind.
