goal today is to get the `interactive door` example scene up and running this morning before my brother-in-law gets here.

because, after that, him, the wife, and i are all going to go wine tasting for the afternoon.  and by the time i get back to my laptop, i'mma gonna be useless!  heh.

oh, hey.  since it seems to be a thing with all this radical transparency, lots of folks are approaching me to chat, so i'm going to work on setting up office hours -- where i'm just going to be available for questions and the like.

it feels like there's an opportunity to chat with our community and working through lots of the intricacies of building experiences on decentraland.  a super-nerdy-lets-all-talk-open-call seems like it would be valuable.  i suspect a lot of these questions would be great public knowledge for all developers, not just one or two.

lemme figure out how i want to structure that.
