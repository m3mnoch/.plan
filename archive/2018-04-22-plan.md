because i'm one of those guys who has most of his amazing ideas in the shower, i present today's episode of _shower thoughts with chris_:

1) this whole decentralized virtual world thing is really missing volatile runtime state data storage.  i should go look, but it feels like there should be a golem-ipfs-like chain service for it.  like a decentralized memcache.

2) this morning, i installed haxe and openfl again (new laptop) and revisited some of my side explorations of it from back in 2014 or so.  man, it's come a long way.  makes me wonder, since [typescript<->haxe](https://github.com/jeremyfa/node-ts2hx) is a thing these days, would a dcl client [crosscompiled to ios](https://haxe.org/use-cases/mobile/) also be a thing?
