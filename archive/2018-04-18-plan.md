lots of talk in-house on parcel limits and how we want to set up a solid precedent around being good neighbors.  because, you know, it would suck if your neighbor has a monster vr rig and drops down a 20 million triangle scene with 5 gigs of textures right next to yours.

"don't look south, johnny!  don't do it!"

[entire laptop freezes]

"you looked south, didn't you . . . "

man, lots of code refactoring work today.

having issues working through the fact that we don't have central, strong state management for our react-like framework.  it's peachy if your parcel is static, or mostly static, but when you start getting a few independent, interactive things going on, it's going to be an awful developer experience.  howeer, agus is right, we shouldn't build that in when not everyone is going to care -- it's just javascript in a web browser, so people who need one can bring their own.

and, just like my soon-to-be-podcast-host-when-we-get-around-to-it friend dani says, "redux is only 90 lines of code."

so, what that means is we're going to leave off the more complex code examples for this next little bit.  at least until i can figure out how to cleanly handle central state management.
