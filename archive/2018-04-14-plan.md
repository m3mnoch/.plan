answered a few questions from the community today.  i love being able to talk to folks.  helping them understand the state of the platform.  i feel like it's super-important.

also, their feedback helps us shape answers to the right questions -- whether it's to explain an existing thing, or to create new tech we didn't realize we needed.

jumped on the train to head up to santa monica for a blockchain game conference.  was lots of fun hanging out with the gang.  thanks for setting it up, gabby!
