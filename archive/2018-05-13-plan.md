man.  one of the things that bugs me the most is high-confidence, low-experience, bad-intuition engineers.  

they tend to have outsized influence with non-engineers because of their ability to sound like they know what they're talking about.  but, in reality, they just spout stupid.  usually, it's just a phase, but it can be almost dangerous along the way as they make tons of work for people like me to unwind.

so, [i tend to be cranky and condescending with them](https://www.reddit.com/r/decentraland/comments/8gum3o/i_am_esteban_founder_and_tech_lead_at/dyhbewv/?st=jh276ynw&sh=fce835e9).

spent most of the day designing a first-party game.  it's gonna be soooooo cool.

here's a concept blurb thing:

> #### Overview
> 
> Three warring factions of alien robots compete for resources in order to be the first to repair their spaceship and get back to their own planet. It's a contest of wits, might, and espionage as they root around, salvaging among the fallen debris scattered from the space battle happening in the skies over decentraland.
> 
> #### Basic Gameplay
> 
> Three alien factions, each with their own massive, sentient energy crystal, follow its instructions in order to salvage the proper resources and build a craft and return to their planet. Players are sentient alien robots, resurrected by the crystal's last remaining energy for this purpose. Over the course of about a real-world week, the players will forage among nearby meteorites, world ruins and debris, and space battle wreckages to build the tools, factories, and drones necessary to reconstruct their spaceship.
> 
> The players will be able to cooperatively gather their own faction's resources, build factories and machinery, defend their equipment from the other factions, or sabotage the other factions' resources and equipment. The energy crystal will guide its faction as to which tasks need accomplishing in which order by distributing quests among the players in support of the escape plan.
> 
> Once a ship is built, the winning faction escapes to their home planet and the round is over. Rewards are given out to the first, second, and third place faction members based on their contributions to the efforts. Once the rewards are doled out, the crash site is wiped, and a new round starts, beginning with falling space battle wreckages crashing anew into Decentraland.

you guys would play that, right?
