heading back to san diego.  on the train for a couple hours.  might as well work on the sample code a bit.

oh!  and i need to write up my objectives for the upcoming quarter.

and, there's the blurb for the next project update post.

man, all this paperwork!

while i'm procrastinating on that paperwork, i was thinking on last night, and how one of the things we were talking about, i'm really excited about.  it's for the upcoming consensus work around a digital item (aka, nft) experience translation/interchange format.  i think that could be really, really valuable.  especially if it's a widely accepted draft.

in fact, here are some globs of text i'm translating from when i was thinking about it earlier this year:

- the goal is to translate things like in-game items from game-to-game.
- for example, turning your +3 broadsword into a plasma cannon for a spaceship battle sim.
- each item would have two sets of basic properties
	- cosmetics
	- utility
- for the cosmetics
	- relative size
	- primary and secondary color schemes
	- construction materials and components
	- narrative flavor.  basically a largish official list of stylistic descriptors:  villain, light-hearted, water, etc.
- for the utility
	- basic function category (clothing, weapon, building, etc.)
	- secondary function category (headgear, projectile, courthouse, etc.)
	- features (huge list from strength buff to environment protection)
	- relative feature effectiveness scale (from 0-100% most effective equipment available in the game)

i really imagine it as a pocket of metadata that lives within the original item that was purchased.  games can choose which parts they want to translate and map to their own in-game items.

even if we start with something as simple as definitions for base clothing -- something strictly cosmetic that's tied to identity.  even using that as the starting point for default character creation could have some really powerful player game-equity effects.
