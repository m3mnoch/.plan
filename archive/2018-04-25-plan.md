so much strategy!

hopefully, we'll be able to work through decisions on things like identity, the part mana plays, and any intrinsic risks we can foresee with all our plans.

my calendar just got wiped-and-reset for the week while i'm down here in buenos aires.

doh!

we're doing an internal "dogfooding" hackathon this week.  man, i hope i can find time to play!  i have so many things i want to build!

---

came up for air on the documents i'm reviewing.  had a thought.

the enormity of what we're building is not lost on us.  i promise.  what's interesting, is that i suspect many other players in the space are missing it.

meaning, true digital asset ownership changes everything.

for example:

1) you make your virtual world digital assets truly ownable.  yay, hats on the blockchain!

2) a user can modify that asset with a different service.

3) that asset can be used in a different game.

4) if a user truly owns their hat, they will want to truly own their avatar.

5) if they truly own their avatar, they can do horrible things to that avatar and force a centralized company to censor that avatar and its items.

6) someone else not in your nation state will allow that avatar and their items in a competing world or game.

7) at best, your tools just become content creation tools for other games and applications.  at worst, your world becomes a ghost town.

true digital asset ownership means true digital asset portability -- and there's NOTHING the naive "look at us!  we've got items on the blockchain!" company can do about it.

and none of this even touches the legal implications -- like, who owns your cryptokitty?  what happens when a non-nation state does what they want with the data?

because, now that real, cryptographically secure, economic scarcity exists, there will soon be such a thing as a "non-nation state".

like i said, true digital asset ownership changes everything.  absolutely everything.

speaking of.

at dinner, a few of us had a fairly heated discussion around nft, brand value, utility value, and importing into other games.

the scenario:

the fede-item is rare, and highly collectible based on its brand.  it has utility in the form of a specific set of properties that only appear at the specific rarity, but it's brand value is really what makes the market price so high -- everyone loves fede.  it's valued at $1 million.

the generic-item is exactly the same, but without the trusted, fede brand name.  same rarity.  same utility.  vastly cheaper.  it's the generic brand.  nobody has heard of it, so it's valued at $1.

a popular game developer decides to allow players to import those tokens into their game.  because they have the exact same rarity and properties, each item gets imported as the exact same hat in the game -- a `Fedora of Awesome` which gives you +100 to your healing rate.

it's a high-utility item in the game.

what happens to the market value of both tokens?

the guys were trying to convince me that the value of the fede-item outside of the game would not change just because a popular game started using it.

i think the generic-item drastically rises in market value, and settles around the same market value as the actual game-item nft has.  i think the fede-item drops in market value now that it has a utility-anchor price.  

basically, because the ephemeral nature of brand popularity.  to have that market value, fede-item is at its market apex and is ready to enter deflationary territory.  the popular game is rising in social value, and anchors the utility of its game items.

it's a dorky discussion.  nobody knows.  this is all random ramblings we're just shouting at each other in a small restaurant, steeped in our 5th glasses of wine.

but!

i think an important discovery i made was that in the physical world, utility for high-value, branded items is dampened because of the fear of damaging them.  the same doesn't apply to digital items.  there's no such thing as "mint condition".

the example i used was if you had the mona lisa and some random framed print, and there was a fly buzzing around, you might use the random framed print to swat at the fly.

it'd be a cold day in hell that you used the mona lisa for that purpose.  you wouldn't want to accidentally damage it.

but, with the same scenario with digital equivalents, it wouldn't matter.  in fact, you' probably use the digital mona lisa _just because_.
