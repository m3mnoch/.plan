was in total systems design mode yesterday.  like what usually happens with me, i only wrote down 10% of my thoughts, but it's the 10% that everything else is derived from.  that's why i loved physics in school.  you just had to remember a few equations and then you could derive everything else!

anyway.  today is spreadsheet time!  YES!!

any game designer can tell you, spreadsheet time is the best!
