net neutrality here in the united states is [getting thrown out the window tomorrow](http://www.sfweekly.com/news/the-last-days-of-net-neutrality/).  this weekend, i updated our house network accordingly.

i mean, it was getting time to do it with all this messy "tracking everything you do" stuff (ha!  as if i don't just _tell everyone_ myself!), so it was time to privatize our inbound/outbound traffic.

for the house, we have a [luma mesh network](https://lumahome.com/) up and running.  mostly because we're an internet-hungry house and i got tired of killing routers and suffering terrible coverage.  but they've also recently released a vpn thing into the mix.  so, this weekend, i clicked "privacy on" in the app, and watched my network traffic immediately start routing through tennessee.  (i live in san diego)

it was pretty easy.

netflix complained.

i went in, clicked the little _nope_ button on my luma app for the fire tv, and it immediately started routing through our local network again.  like, i clicked _back_ and then tried netflix again, and it _just worked_.  sweet.

it was pretty easy.

then my son complained about the network speed.

"dad!  why does our internet suck?  i'm only getting six megabytes down on my xbox!"  (first-world problems, amirite?!?).  i push-of-a-button turned off the vpn for his xbox, and his game download immediately jumped back up to 40mbps.

again, it was pretty easy.

what this tells me is i have granular control, which is good.  also, that netflix may want to rethink its anti-vpn stance now.  in the meantime, i may just get a fire stick or something and use it just for streaming netflix.  but that's a pain in the ass.

regardless, it was pretty easy for me, personally, to deal with the fallout of this stupid net neutrality reversal.

oh!  so, this afternoon, i'm flying down to buenos aires to hang with all the guys and make some decisions.  i'm super-excited.

i'll keep you guys posted on the sort of stuff we're talking about.  right now, the rough, high-level view of the stuff we're talking about revolves around risk (not the competitive kind, we don't really care about that), our 2018 company charter plans, how crypto-collectibles intersect with our platform, and some technical direction stakes-in-the-ground.

like usual, i'll let you guys know what we decide.

in the meantime, let us know what you think about the new sdk thing we're launching.  i think it's super-cool for a whole bunch of interesting reasons.

was looking at the [cryptocarz website](https://cryptocarz.io/) from blockchain studios.  a) it seems pretty sweet.  b) i had an idea.  i dunno if it's in their plans, but how cool would it be to have a race assembled from a series of random events, and skill/ability rolls from your driver/car?  from car handling properties, to malfunction thresholds, to driver reaction time, to driver practice attempts.  so, you can effectively have a completely autonomous "race simulation" that everyone can go through.

and then, on raceday: "here's your random seed -- go!"  

from there, everyone has the same, precise, deterministic series of random values to navigate.  the car and driver that perform the best, wins.  and, best yet, the race can happen in a completely asynchronous way.

and all of it validated on the blockchain.

i'd totally play that.
