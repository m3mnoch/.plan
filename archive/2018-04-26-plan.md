so, this morning, doing more thinking on nft and marketplaces.

i've long been a "we don't want to be in the marketplace business" advocate when talking about decentraland.  that, of course, has the caveat of "outside of a tool to service our community's needs in support of our token".  aka, our awesome [land marketplace](https://market.decentraland.org/).

but a general nft marketplace?  it's hard for me to visualize the business model there.  the traditional marketplace model of transaction fees seems hard.

for example, how is it not a race to the bottom with fees because anyone anywhere at any time can facilitate the exchange of assets?  like, how does the marketplace not end up with a back-channel "hey, i'll give you more than you'd get for the top bid, but it's cheaper for me because we're going around any fee structure" option?  because the thing about blockchain is there's no more need for middlemen.

the only thing i can come up with to attach value to is advertising.  so, spending money to have a higher placement in lists.  standard ads.  anything really to raise awareness of your nft you have for sale.

so, all of the middleman, banker-like, asymmetrical information-based business models disappear.  gatekeeper value goes to zero -- instead, the value is in the tastemaker's hands.  the critics.  the reviewers.  the evangelists and marketers.

basically, the value is in attention.

i guess i hadn't really considered it before, but in this world without middlemen, facilitated by the blockchain, we're full-steam headed for the [attention economy](http://kk.org/thetechnium/where-attention/).

okay.  for reals.  i have to write some code for this internal hackathon thing.

also, eric is going to be mad that i'm doing all this instead of the new game design blog post.  oops!
