finally worked through all of the building costs and the drop rates.  all of it, of course, configurable to calculate the proper amount of resource availability per-building.

here's a snapshot of the level one factories and such.  keep in mind, when looking at the cost curve, things like the `specialized tools factory` have dependencies on building a level 2 `recycler`.

so, yeah.  not pictured: dependency chains.
