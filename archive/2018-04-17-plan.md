got the interactive door example up and running today.  it was a piece of cake.

the video playback one, tho.  man, it's being a booger.

on the brightside, i'm working through the guts of how to blend scene.xml files with scene.tsx files.  it's pretty nice how compatible they are.  the guys did a great job with that.

however, i'm having issues with both the remote video link and the text for for the ui.  i'm doing something dumb, i'm sure.

anyhow.  aside from a few meetings today, i didn't feel very productive.  gonna have to bang through this stuff in the morning.
