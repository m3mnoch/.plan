so, had an email exchange with the cards against humanity guys.  i thought it would be fun to take advantage of their creative commons license, and use their cards as a demo for our audience. specifically as an example on how to structure their own mutliplayer games.

after chatting a bit, it seems like they're getting lots of folks abusing their license . . .

hey, people: STOP ABUSING THE CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE!

because, dammit, you're going to ruin it for the rest of us!

for my hackathon, i ended up with an awful demo.  especially compared to juan, dani, and nacho.  mine was basically, here's how to implement a finite state machine to handle the different large phases of your game -- for example, logo splash, preferences, play, reset, matchmaking, etc.

it was super boooring compared to a giant shark aquarium with flocking fish and multiplayer arcade cabinets.

heh.  hackathons are awesome.

started putting together a game starter kit -- basically all the general pieces you need to make a basic game on decentraland.  including that state machine, signals, custom logging, gobs, and a random tweener.
