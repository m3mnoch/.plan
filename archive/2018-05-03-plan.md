ha!  i totally forgot to rotate my plan yesterday.

basically, yesterday i did:

- design and research around spawners and pooling
- buffing out my loot crate blog post
- chatting with community members
- a squishy bit of recruiting work

---

researching some video capture stuff.  right now, i'm playing with [obs](https://obsproject.com/) and it seems good, if not a bit clunky.  just trying to find something that'll snap at a decent frame rate.

maybe i'll just borrow my son's capture card.

something interesting i just said in a different conversation that i don't want to lose:

> the world will eventually figure out that platform plays aren't viable in crypto-land.  it'll be about service economies instead.  the world of decentralized assets doesn't need centralized platforms.

had a long, awesome phone conversation with daniele over at [cryptocarz.io](https://cryptocarz.io) -- that guy is awesome.  he's definitely got his head moving in the right direction.

you guys should read their [drive paper](https://www.cryptocarz.io/docs/CryptoCarz_WP.pdf) (the engineer in him couldn't bear to call it a whitepaper) to see what their project is all about.
