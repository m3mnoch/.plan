hey there!  long time, no talk!  i've been super, ridiculously busy of late.  mostly talking to awesome game designers about the various projects they want to build on decentraland.

unfortunately, since we (decentraland) don't own their ip or designs, i can't really tell you about a lot of the coolest things.

however!  good news!

i'm getting some folks in-place to help me scale!  yay!  so that means, dammit, i'm getting back to this .plan stuff.

because i miss talking to you guys.
