working on buffing up the scene examples with nicer art.  shibu is the MASTER of low-poly scenic flair.

also, finally working on this blog post for the loot crates rpg design.  so excited to actually build it.  some day.  when i find a dumpster full of time.

on the bright side, eric is going to be so excited i've found time to work on it!  i don't want to make him a sad panda!

my design post for that loot crate game?  omg, i _REALLY_ want to make that thing.  man, i hope i can find the time to build it.

tho, worst-case i suppose, we get the post up, and at least someone else finds it a cool idea and would find time to make it.
