so behind on these!  couple things to catch up on.

first, i rolled up to l.a. to hit up the [l.a. games conference](https://lagamesconference.com/) to meet with tony and trevor.

1) watched tony distribute mad-awesome advice on his panel.  couple of the other guys' advice was . . . not as awesome.  it's pretty clear that games do not get blockchain yet.  kind of like blockchain's struggles with games.

2) tony, trevor, and i hashed through things like avatars and roads and true self and runtime persistence and using a tcr to do content moderation.  all kinds of crazy stuff.

3) we hung out with a guy from [firstblood](https://firstblood.io/).  their jury model for refereeing matches seems pretty awesome.  it's not full-on decentralized, but it's not centralized.  it's like a sweet, speedy, incentivized, federated model.  i like it.

in my daily work, i've been hashing through an example game-like experience we can use as training on how to build out experiences on the api.  it's equal parts exhilarating and infuriating depending.  lots of trial-and-error as i try to build best practices around how to capture common game patterns in our react-ish/web/vr/p2p framework.

like, it's not hard to execute on the pattern in a terrible fashion -- it's hard to find the _right_ way to do it that's efficient and not awful.

also, i'm in the process of designing games for various parcel estate sizes and current capabilities in our sdk.  we're going to start working in a first-party type situation to build some largish-scope games and entertainment.

but, there's not a lot to talk about on that part yet.  i'm still trying to hash out in my head what all that looks like.
